plan:
    . HANDLE THE ERRORS PROPERLY
      . if some site dosent load, then send a ping on discord instead of crash
      \. if no items are in webelorts.texts, then send ping
    . edit reminders
      . view reminders
        . pretty print? how?
      . save date and time in reminder just so its human readable
        . print this time in message too?
    . reminder importance rating
      . maybe different channel
      . maybe tagging
    . today/tomm -> alias for curr date/ curr date+1
    
    . a way to add new sites using cli
    . maybe keep track of how many matches there were and if it goes different, then ping
    . take &[T] input instead of Vec<T> (confirm first why this happens)
    . do tuples work with structopts?
      . maybe try if variable inputs works
      . for time and date (int, int, int) or something
    . ability to set reminders from discord
      . maybe the discord bot thing?
        . need to run continuously?
    
    . if single dweet is too long(~~10k), then provide method for shortening it (trait)
    . rearrange the stuff in json, so that its easier to read and change
      . do i really need to keep the texts in dweet?
    
    . remove jankness
    . maybe nested searches? in webelorts
      . like search between this and this and then search another time in this text
